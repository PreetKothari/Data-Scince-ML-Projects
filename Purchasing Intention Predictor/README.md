# Purchasing Intention Prediction

In this project, I'll explore the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset. The aim of this project is to understand the data and predict whether a visitor will make 
a purchase or not.

Using various data visualization techniques and performing feature engineering the features that better represent the problem to the predictive model were found and then
predictions were made based on these selected features. With the help of an Artificial Neural Network, predictions were made whether a visitor shall generate revenue for
the company or not, by finding out their purchasing intention.
